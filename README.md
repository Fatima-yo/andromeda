andromeda human interaction - virtual robot

This is the code and multimedia repository for the andromeda project.

If you do not know what andromeda is all about, here is a simple explanation.

Artificial intelligence is becoming fashion right now, but almost all of the work is done about the "thinking" process, that is, machine learning and so. It looks like almost nobody is working on making computers easier to use. This is what Andromeda is all about.

If you want to see how an intelligent computer should look like, we recommend you to go to YouTube.com and watch "Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda". Yes, that is the creator of Star Trek, and this another, not much famous series that he also created. We recommend you to watch the first chapter ("Under the night") but any chapter will do. Wait until the computer appears. You will get it: she talks like a person, and listens like a person.

The computer appears at 29:45 (wait a few seconds) and 38:00 (same here)

It looks imposible, but it is already within our grasp.
